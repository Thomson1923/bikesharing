# Re: Des Moines Bike Sharing Opportunity 

# Overview of Project
## We analyzed data from the Citi Bike program in New York City to assess the attractiveness of a similar program in Des Moines. Despite the differences in the size and demographics of these two cities, we compiled valuable quantitative information that will be critical for the decision-making process. Based on our analysis, we believe that the Des Moines Bike Sharing (DMBS) program can work under certain circumstances.

# Results
## Our analysis of the Citi Bike Sharing Program in New York (displayed in Tableau stories https://public.tableau.com/views/Deliverable2_16108253096520/DMBS-StartingLocation?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) revealed many key trends and risks.
### Location – Based on starting locations for riders, most bike usage occurs in the most densely populated areas. We do not envision extensive geographic reach for the program.
### Use by Gender – While the majority of users will probably be male, we anticipate that females will account for roughly one-quarter of the users, similar to those in NYC
### Checkout Times – Our program will charge based on the length of time that bikes are checked out. The highest utilization occurs in the 4-6 hour range which suggests that the average fare per rental could be very high.
### Checkout Times by Gender – We saw very limited variation in the amount of time that bikes were checked out by men versus women.
### Distribution of Trips – As expected, trip initiation clustered around morning and evening commuting times.
### Distribution of Trips by Gender – As with the number of overall trips, gender differences were not see in the pattern of daily usage.
### Usertypes - Riders registered as subscribers should account for the majority of rides.

# Summary
## We feel that the Des Moines Bike Sharing program could work. Our follow-up analysis will include a quartile analysis of subscriber usage and understanding the relative importance of trips outside densely populated areas.
